# Portfolio dev Bog

This is a place where I am going to be documenting things I learn as I develop some of my side projects and revamp my existing projects.

This will range from very simple and somewhat trivial concepts to more indepth concepts as I get further along in my career and learn more.

I mainly just look at it as a way to document just about anything and everything I learn, because I don't think any experience learning on your own should be deemed as invaluable.

Happy coding!
